# Phase 1b — WS2: Course-builder UX overhaul (design)

Date: 2026-06-16 · Status: design accepted (brainstorming), pending spec review → plan.
Accepted mockup: `docs/mockups/builder_accepted.html` (light + dark, all five items).

## 1. Scope

Redesign the **course-builder tree pane** and the **Move picker** (which lives in the
detail panel). Covers the five WS2 triage items:

- **#5** connector lines (tree hierarchy is too subtle)
- **#6** a tidy, consistent per-row control cluster
- **#8** a Move UI that shows *which* node is moving and allows precise placement
- **#11** contextual "+" add affordances (only legal kinds; no persistent kind dropdown)
- **#9c** drag-and-drop reorder/re-parent (pointer devices)

The full design is captured now so the markup/CSS/JS are built once; **implementation may
still sequence #9c last** (see §9).

**Out of scope:** the detail-panel editors, element/media work (other slices); the
delete-confirm flow (unchanged — see §4.6); touch drag-and-drop (deferred, §4.5); a
keyboard "drag mode" (the ↑/↓ buttons + Move picker already give keyboard users full
reorder/re-parent). No model or migration changes. No new server endpoints.

## 2. Current state (what we're changing)

Two-pane layout (`builder.html`): left `.builder__tree`, right `.builder__panel[data-panel]`.
The tree is a recursive `<ol>`/`<li>` structure:

- `_scope.html` — `<ol class="tree__scope" data-scope data-updated>` wrapping a parent's children.
- `_tree_node.html` — a `<li class="tree__row" data-node data-updated data-kind data-parent>` with
  a kind badge, a `data-select` title button, an action span (`_move_buttons.html` ↑/↓ form +
  `Move…` link + `Delete` link), and — for non-units — a nested `_scope.html` + `_add_form.html`.
- `_add_form.html` — a persistent per-scope form: title input + **kind `<select>` listing ALL
  kinds** + (hidden) unit_type select + Add.
- `_move_picker.html` — panel form: node_token + a `<select name="new_parent">` of candidates +
  a numeric `position`.

Backend (unchanged, already fully tested in `tests/test_manage_node_ops.py`):

- `courses/views_manage.py`: `node_add`, `node_move` (`mode=reorder` ±1 / `mode=reparent` with
  `position`), `_move_picker`, `_render_scope`/`_render_tree`, `_children_map`.
- `courses/builder.py`: `add_node`, `reorder_node`, `reparent_node` (+ `place_node` at a 0-based
  position), optimistic `_check_token`.
- `courses/ordering.py` + `ContentNode.RANK = {part:0, chapter:1, section:2, unit:3}`; a child's
  kind must be **strictly deeper** than its parent's.
- `courses/static/courses/js/builder.js` — fetch-and-swap by `[data-scope]`; panel-refresh after a
  panel-form op (the #9 fix); `_move_picker` reads each option's `data-updated` as `parent_token`.
- `courses/static/courses/css/builder.css` — interim layout (to be largely replaced).

This is a **frontend redesign**: templates, `builder.css`, `builder.js`. The service layer and
endpoints are reused as-is; drag-and-drop and the new Move picker map onto the **existing**
`reorder`/`reparent` contracts.

## 3. Legal-kind logic (shared by #11 and #9c)

`legal_child_kinds(parent_kind)` = the kinds a node of `parent_kind` may directly contain, in RANK
order. **Directional term:** "deeper" = **larger RANK** = closer to `unit`; a child's kind must be
strictly deeper (larger RANK) than its parent's — matching `_move_picker`'s `RANK[n.kind] <
RANK[node.kind]`. At the top (no parent → `parent_kind = None`) all four are legal:

| parent | legal child kinds (RANK order) |
|---|---|
| top (none) | part, chapter, section, unit |
| part | chapter, section, unit |
| chapter | section, unit |
| section | unit |
| unit | — (units hold elements, not nodes) |

A new server helper `courses/ordering.py:legal_child_kinds(parent_kind_or_None)` takes a **kind
string or `None`** (NOT a node) and returns this list in RANK order. Call sites derive the argument:
the top scope passes `None`; a nested scope passes its parent node's `.kind`. It is the single
source for both the contextual "+" affordances and the drag-drop drop-legality check, and mirrors
the depth rule already enforced in `ContentNode.clean()`.

## 4. Design decisions

### 4.1 #5 — Connector lines

Vertical guide lines via `border-left` on the `.tree__scope` `<ol>`s. Because the **outermost**
scope shares the same `.tree__scope` class (`data-scope="top"`), pin the selectors explicitly: the
top scope (`.builder__tree > .tree__scope`, i.e. `[data-scope="top"]`) gets the **stronger**
`--border-strong` guide — the spine under the course root, as in the mockup — and nested scopes
(`.tree__row .tree__scope`) get the lighter `--border-default`. No new markup — the nested
`<ol data-scope>` already exists. Light/dark both use border tokens (verified in the mockup).
Row elbow ticks are an optional later refinement, not required.

### 4.2 #6 — Per-row control cluster

Replace the loose action span with one right-aligned **icon cluster** per row:
`grip · ↑ · ↓ · move · delete`. Requirements:

- **Icon buttons** with `title` + `aria-label` tooltips; consistent sizing; right-aligned so
  titles line up across rows. Icons = an inline **SVG sprite** (`<symbol>`/`<use>`) defined once
  in `builder.html` as a **direct child of `.builder`** (sibling of both `.builder__tree` and
  `.builder__panel`, inside neither) so `<use>` references keep resolving after **both** a tree
  `[data-scope]` swap and a panel `innerHTML` swap — the Move-picker's moving-node chip and any
  panel-rendered icons reference the same sprite (grip, up, down, move, trash).
- **Always visible**, low-contrast by default (`opacity ~.5`), brightening to full on row
  hover/focus and on the selected row. **No hover-only controls** — touch has no hover.
- Behaviour wiring (progressive enhancement, all existing):
  - ↑/↓ = the existing `data-op="reorder"` two-button form (works no-JS; JS fragment-swaps).
    **Disable ↑ on the first child and ↓ on the last** (via `forloop.first`/`forloop.last` in
    `_scope.html`, passed to `_tree_node.html`) so boundaries are clear and a11y-correct; the
    server still treats any stray boundary submit as a no-op (`move_in_list` → `None` → unchanged).
  - move = the existing `data-move` link → opens the picker in the panel (§4.3).
  - delete = the existing `data-delete` link → existing confirm flow (§4.6).
  - **grip** = drag handle; JS-only (§4.5). Absent/inert with JS off.

### 4.3 #8 — Move UI

The Move picker is redesigned and continues to live in the detail panel (reusing the #9
panel-refresh fix). When opened:

- The **moving node is highlighted** in the tree (JS adds a `moving` state to its row).
- The panel shows: a **"Move" header**, the **moving node as a chip** (badge + title), then a
  **"Destination & position"** control built as an **indented mini-tree of legal destinations**
  (the existing `_move_picker` candidate set: structural nodes whose kind is strictly **shallower
  (smaller RANK)** than the moving node's — the inverse of §3's child-deeper-than-parent rule —
  excluding itself/descendants, plus "Top level").
- Selecting a destination reveals **insertion slots** among that destination's children,
  **excluding the moving node itself** when it already lives there (matching `place_node`'s
  `others = siblings.exclude(pk=node.pk)`). Let `others` = those remaining children, 0-indexed; each
  slot is an **insert-before index**: slot 0 = before the first child (top), slot _i_ = between
  `others[i-1]` and `others[i]`, slot _N_ = after the last (end). The chosen slot **is** the 0-based
  `position` passed to `reparent_node` (`place_node` computes `others[:position] + [node] +
  others[position:]`). This makes arbitrary placement (e.g. between lesson 2 and 3) exact, with **no
  off-by-one when re-parenting within the current parent** (the moving node is never drawn as one of
  its own slots).

**Progressive enhancement:** the **no-JS baseline** is the existing picker form — a
`<select name="new_parent">` of candidates (each `<option>` carrying `data-updated`) + a numeric
`<input name="position">` — which already submits `mode=reparent` correctly. JS **layers the nice
UI on top**: it renders the indented destination tree + insertion slots, hides the raw
select/number, and on each click **syncs** the chosen destination into the hidden `new_parent`
select (so `parent_token` is read from that option's `data-updated`, as today) and the chosen slot
index into the hidden `position` field. One form, one endpoint, no ambiguity; the raw controls are
the source of truth that the enhanced UI drives. The rewritten no-JS `position` field ships
**`value=""`** (not the current `value="0"`), so a no-JS submit that doesn't touch it **appends to
the end** of the destination — the least-surprising default (`node_move`: empty → `None` → append,
`position = int(position) if position not in (None, "") else None`); an explicit number still
places at that index.

**Picker/highlight lifecycle:** the `moving` highlight is added when the picker opens and **cleared
on** cancel/Esc, on selecting a different node, and on a successful move. A successful re-parent
returns the **whole tree** (`_render_tree`), which replaces the tree DOM — so the JS must clear all
transient state (the `moving` class, any open inline-add row, any open `+…` menu) at/before the
swap, and the panel is reset by the #9 panel-refresh (re-fetches the moved node's fresh panel).

### 4.4 #11 — Contextual "+" add affordances

Replace the persistent `_add_form.html` (with its all-kinds `<select>`) with **contextual
"+" chips** (a new `_add_affordance.html`). **Render location:** the affordance is the **last item
inside `_scope.html`'s `<ol>`** — a trailing `<li class="tree__add-row">` after the children loop —
so it (a) sits at the end of that scope's child list, (b) is part of the scope's swapped fragment
(survives `_render_scope`/`_render_tree`), (c) renders for the **top** scope too (today's top-level
add lives in `builder.html`, *outside* the swapped fragment — that is retired), and (d) renders for
**empty** scopes (a freshly created part/chapter/section, or an empty course) so every non-unit
node always exposes its legal `+` chips. `_scope.html` gains a `parent_kind` param to compute the
kinds. **Threading it through every render path:** the top scope passes `parent_kind=None` (from
`builder.html`, and from `_render_scope`/`_render_tree` when `scope_ref=="top"`); a **nested** scope
is rendered by `_tree_node.html`'s recursive `_scope.html` include, which must pass
`parent_kind=node.kind`; a single nested-scope re-render passes `parent_kind=parent.kind`
(`_render_scope` already fetches `parent`) — and when that `parent` is `None` (the vanished-parent
409 path) the affordance is omitted. **`builder.html`** drops its top-level `_add_form` include and
its `{% if top_nodes %}` branch, including `_scope.html` unconditionally; a **neutral per-scope empty hint** moves into
`_scope.html` (e.g. "No children yet" — *not* the old course-level "Empty course — add your first
node", which would read oddly under every empty chapter/section), shown beside the `+` chips when
the scope has no children. Each scope
offers only `legal_child_kinds(parent_kind)` (§3), rendered by this rule:

- `len(legal) == 0` → no affordance (units).
- `len(legal) <= 2` → a `+ Kind` chip per kind (RANK order). → Section: `+ Unit`; Chapter:
  `+ Section  + Unit`.
- `len(legal) >= 3` → a **primary** `+ Kind` chip + a `+…` **overflow** menu listing the rest
  (RANK order). The primary lives beside `legal_child_kinds` in `courses/ordering.py` as
  `PRIMARY_CHILD_KIND = {None: "chapter", "part": "chapter"}` (keyed by parent kind; `None` = the
  top scope) — the only parents with ≥3 legal kinds; a `parent_kind` with no entry has ≤2 legal
  kinds and never reaches this branch.
  → top: `+ Chapter` + `+…`(Part, Section, Unit); part: `+ Chapter` + `+…`(Section, Unit).

This removes illegal choices by construction (solving #11's "shows forbidden kinds").

**Add interaction — inline new row:** clicking `+ Kind` inserts a transient editable row at the
add-spot, indented to that level, showing the kind badge and a focused title field.

- **Enter** (or **blur with non-empty text**) → POST the existing `node_add`. Fields: **`parent` =
  the scope's `scope_id`** (`"top"` for the top scope, the parent node's pk for nested — matching
  `node_add`'s `request.POST.get("parent", "top")`), `kind`, `title`, and `parent_token` = the
  scope's `data-updated` — which for the **top** scope is the **course** token `course.updated` (per
  `builder.html`) and for a nested scope is the parent node's token; `unit_type=lesson` when
  `kind==unit`, else none. On 200 the scope swaps in the saved node (existing fragment flow).
- **Esc** (or **blur while empty**) → discard the transient row, no request.
- **Empty title + Enter** → inline "required" hint; stay editing (do not submit).
- **Blur ordering:** at most **one** inline-add row is open at a time; clicking another `+` chip,
  the `+…` menu, or a different row first commits the current row if it has text (else discards it),
  so there is no double-create or lost-input race.
- Units default to **`unit_type=lesson`**; switch to quiz later in unit settings (quiz stays the
  Phase-2-inert placeholder). Keeps the inline row to a single field.

No-JS fallback: each `+ Kind` chip is the submit of a tiny per-kind form whose POST body matches
the JS path **exactly** — hidden `parent`=`scope_id`, `kind`=that kind, `parent_token`=the scope's
`data-updated`, a `title` text input, and **`unit_type=lesson` on the unit chip** (required, else
`clean()` 422s "Units require a unit_type"). Degrades to the current per-scope add behaviour, minus
the illegal kinds.

### 4.5 #9c — Drag-and-drop (pointer devices)

Grab a row by its **grip** handle to reorder or re-parent in one gesture. Built in `builder.js`.

- **Drop feedback:** a teal **insertion line** at the landing spot (indented to the target
  parent's level) + a dashed **highlight on the destination container** during dragover.
- **Mapping to the backend:** every drop = `mode=reparent` with `new_parent` = the target
  container (its pk, or "top") and `position` = the **insert-before index** as defined in §4.3 (into
  the destination's children, excluding the moving/dragged node). **Cross-parent drop:** the dragged
  row isn't among the destination's children, so dropping above the child at index _k_ → `position`
  _k_. **Same-parent drop:** exclude the dragged row first (so dragging item 1 to between items 3
  and 4 → `position` 2, not 3), matching `place_node`'s `exclude(pk=node.pk)`. This single path
  covers both same-parent reordering (to an arbitrary index — which the ±1 reorder buttons can't
  express) and cross-parent re-parenting, because `reparent_node`/`place_node` already accept
  same-or-different parent + 0-based position. Tokens: `node_token` = dragged row's `data-updated`,
  `parent_token` = target container's `data-updated` (the **course** token for a top-level drop).
  On success the whole tree swaps + the panel refreshes (existing reparent flow + #9 fix).
- **Illegal drops refused client-side:** no insertion line / "no-drop" cursor when the dragged
  node's kind is **not** strictly deeper than the target parent's (`legal_child_kinds`, §3) or the
  target is the node itself or a descendant. The server still enforces this (`assert_not_descendant`
  → 422; depth via `full_clean` → 422) as defense-in-depth.
- **Pointer only.** Touch does **not** initiate drag (deferred); touch users reorder/re-parent
  with the always-visible ↑/↓ buttons and the Move picker, which cover every case. The ↑/↓
  buttons and Move picker remain for **all** users (precision, keyboard, accessibility).

### 4.6 Unchanged by design

- **Delete** keeps its existing confirm flow (with the cascade descendant/element-count warning);
  WS2 only restyles the trigger into the cluster. Data-safety stays explicit.
- **Layout** stays the two-pane tree | detail panel. The optimistic-token contract (409/422 +
  fresh fragment) and the #9 panel-refresh are unchanged and relied upon.

## 5. Components & files

- **Templates:** `_tree_node.html` (cluster + `draggable`/drag hooks + ↑/↓ boundary disabling via
  passed `forloop.first`/`last`; **passes `parent_kind=node.kind` to its nested `_scope.html`
  include**), `_scope.html` (gains a `parent_kind` param; hosts the trailing `_add_affordance` `<li>`
  + the empty-scope hint; passes first/last flags to `_tree_node`), `_move_buttons.html` (folded
  into the cluster's ↑/↓), **new** `_add_affordance.html` (replaces `_add_form.html`),
  `_move_picker.html` (rewritten: indented destinations + slots; no-JS `position` defaults to
  `value=""`), `builder.html` (inline SVG icon sprite **outside** swap regions; top-level `_add_form`
  removed + `{% if top_nodes %}` branch dropped — `_scope.html` is now included unconditionally).
- **CSS:** `builder.css` — largely rewritten: connectors, cluster (always-visible/hover-emphasis,
  icon buttons), `+` chips + overflow menu, inline new-row, redesigned picker, drag insertion
  line + drop-target highlight + ghost. Light + dark via existing tokens (no new tokens).
- **JS:** `builder.js` — add: inline new-row lifecycle (insert/focus/Enter/Esc/blur), `+…`
  overflow menu, picker destination-select → reveal slots + `moving` highlight, drag-and-drop
  (grip drag, dragover insertion line + drop-target, legality check, drop → reparent POST). Keep
  the existing fetch-and-swap + panel-refresh.
- **Views (`views_manage.py`):** pass `parent_kind` into `_scope.html` (`None` for `scope_ref=="top"`,
  else `parent.kind`; omit the affordance when `parent is None`); render the redesigned
  `_move_picker` (destinations + each destination's children for slots — reuse `_children_map`).
  `node_add` and `node_move`(reparent) are unchanged. **Drop the now-dead `kind_choices`** context
  from `builder`/`_render_scope` (only `_add_form.html`, being retired, consumed it).
- **New helper:** `legal_child_kinds(parent_kind_or_None)` + `PRIMARY_CHILD_KIND` in
  `courses/ordering.py`, surfaced to templates as **two `simple_tag`s in `courses_manage_extras.py`**:
  `legal_child_kinds parent_kind` → list of kind strings (RANK order), and `primary_child_kind
  parent_kind` → kind string or `None`. `_add_affordance.html` branches on the list length
  (`==0` none / `<=2` chips / `>=3` primary chip + `+…` overflow of the remainder).

## 6. Data flow (summary)

- **Add:** `+ Kind` → inline row → `node_add(parent, kind, title, parent_token)` → scope swap.
- **Reorder (±1):** unchanged `mode=reorder` form → scope/tree swap.
- **Move (picker):** select destination + slot → `mode=reparent(new_parent, position,
  node_token, parent_token)` → whole-tree swap + panel refresh.
- **Drag-drop:** drop → same `mode=reparent` call (new_parent = container, position = insertion
  index) → whole-tree swap + panel refresh.

## 7. Accessibility & responsive

- Cluster icons are real `<button>`s with `aria-label`/`title`; always visible (no hover-only).
- Full keyboard path: Tab to a row's cluster, ↑/↓ to reorder, move to open the picker (radio
  destinations + slots, operable without a pointer). Drag is a pointer-only enhancement.
- Mobile/narrow: the two-pane grid stacks (existing `@media`); the picker stacks below the tree
  (or opens as a sheet). All actions reachable without hover or drag.

## 8. Testing

- **Playwright e2e** (extend `tests/test_e2e_builder_reorder.py` style; `-m e2e`): each level shows
  exactly its legal `+` kinds (Section → only `+ Unit`; top → `+ Chapter` + overflow); inline add
  creates the right kind; the cluster is visible and ↑/↓ reorder; the Move picker is indented and an
  insertion slot places a node at the chosen position (incl. between two existing children);
  **same-parent placement — the C4/I1 off-by-one: move *and* drag a node to a slot within its
  current parent (e.g. item 1 → between items 3 and 4) and assert the final sibling order is
  exactly [2, 3, 1, 4]**; drag-drop reorders within a parent and re-parents across, landing at the
  dropped slot; an illegal drag target is refused; the top-level and empty-scope `+` affordances
  render. Light + dark visual sanity.
- **Unit/view tests:** `legal_child_kinds` per parent kind (incl. `None`/top); `_add_affordance`/
  picker context (legal kinds, `PRIMARY_CHILD_KIND` primary/overflow grouping, destinations);
  `node_add` defaults `unit_type=lesson` for inline unit add. (Backend arbitrary-position
  `place_node` is already covered by `tests/test_manage_node_ops.py`; the new e2e cases target the
  **UI's index→position conversion**, which that backend suite does not exercise.)
- Regression: the existing builder e2e and `test_e2e_builder_reorder.py` must still pass.

## 9. Implementation sequencing

1. **Static tree + add (#5, #6, #11):** connectors, the SVG icon sprite + cluster, the
   `legal_child_kinds` helper + `_add_affordance` (chips/overflow) + inline new-row; retire
   `_add_form.html`. Rewrite the relevant `builder.css`.
2. **Move UI (#8):** rewrite `_move_picker.html` (indented destinations + slots) + the JS to
   reveal slots and highlight the moving node.
3. **Drag-and-drop (#9c) last:** grip drag, insertion line + drop-target, legality check, drop →
   reparent. Independent of 1–2 and the riskiest, so it lands on top of a working tree.

Each step keeps the suite green and the no-JS fallback working before the next begins.
